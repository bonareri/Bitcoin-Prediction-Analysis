# Bitcoin Price Prediction and Risk Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Bitcoin Price Prediction and Risk Analysis** project leverages machine learning, time-series forecasting, and sentiment analysis techniques to help Bitcoin traders and investors make informed decisions. The system forecasts Bitcoin price movements, evaluates trading risks, and generates actionable trading signals using historical Bitcoin data, market trends, and sentiment data from news and social media.

## Problem Statement

Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and traditional trading methods often fail to address the complexity and rapid fluctuations in its price. This project aims to mitigate these risks by predicting Bitcoin's price movements using machine learning models and incorporating sentiment analysis. The system will generate actionable insights to help traders minimize risks and maximize profitability.

## Key Features

1. **Bitcoin Price Prediction**: Predict short-term and long-term Bitcoin price movements using machine learning and time-series forecasting techniques.
2. **Market Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment from news articles, social media platforms, and financial reports using NLP techniques.
3. **Risk Analysis**: Evaluate risks in Bitcoin trading through volatility metrics, drawdowns, and historical trends.
4. **Trading Signal Generation**: Generate buy, sell, and hold signals based on predictive models and market conditions.
5. **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize Bitcoin price trends, trading signals, and risk levels using interactive dashboards.
6. **Automated Trading**: Implement an automated trading system to execute trades in real-time based on model insights.
